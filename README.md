# Bloc-Notes

**Course:** *React – Composants fonctionnels, Shadcn UI, Vite*  
**Project:** This repo is the hands-on application of the course — a modern, offline-first markdown note-taking app built with React 19, Vite, and IndexedDB. Write in Markdown, preview in real time, and keep your notes stored in the browser; no backend required.

---

## Features

- **Sidebar** — List all notes with title and a short preview (~15 words). One-click new note creation.
- **Live Markdown preview** — Rendered HTML above the editor; supports GFM (tables, strikethrough, etc.) with safe sanitization.
- **Rich editor** — Title and Markdown content with auto-save (debounced) so changes persist without a manual “Save” button.
- **IndexedDB persistence** — Notes are stored in the browser; data survives reloads and works offline. No server or GDPR-sensitive storage.
- **Seed notes** — Optional starter notes generated from the `Resources/` docs; existing user notes are never overwritten.

## Tech Stack

The app in this repo uses the stack below. **The course does not require** state libraries (Zustand), form libraries (React Hook Form, Zod), or a specific linter (Biome) — students are free to use `useState`/Context and their preferred tooling.

| Layer        | Choice                |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Build        | Vite 7                 |
| UI           | React 19, JavaScript   |
| Styling      | Tailwind CSS 4        |
| Components   | CVA, clsx, tailwind-merge, Lucide icons |
| State        | Zustand *(optional; course allows useState/Context)* |
| Persistence  | IndexedDB (idb-keyval) |
| Markdown     | react-markdown, remark-gfm, rehype-raw, rehype-sanitize |
| Forms/validation | React Hook Form, Zod *(optional)* |
| Tooling      | Biome *(optional; ESLint/Prettier or none)* |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm (or compatible package manager)

### Install and run

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bloc-notes
cd bloc-notes-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`).

### Build for production

```bash
cd bloc-notes-app
npm run build
npm run preview   # optional: local preview of the build
```

---

## Scripts (bloc-notes-app)

| Command        | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`  | Start dev server (Vite). Seed script runs before. |
| `npm run build`| Production build. Seed script runs before.        |
| `npm run seed` | Regenerate `src/data/seedNotes.js` from Resources. |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally.           |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint.                                      |

Seed notes are built from Markdown files in `Resources/` (see `scripts/README.md`). On first load, the app injects any missing seed notes into IndexedDB; existing user notes are left unchanged.

- **recommandation.md** — Step-by-step “pro” setup: stack, config, and implementation notes.
- **Shadcn-UI.md**, **Composants-fonctionnels.md** — UI and React patterns (course content).
- **Old/** — Legacy course material (e.g. Class Components); superseded by the current course.
